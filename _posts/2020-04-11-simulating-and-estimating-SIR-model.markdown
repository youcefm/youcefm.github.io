### Dynamic System Equations
Lets start by writing down the functions that describe how the population evolves as the virus spreads.

{% highlight python %}

def dy_dt(y, z, beta, sigma):
    "change in proportion of population infectious"
    y = min(max(0,y),1)
    z = min(max(0,z),1)
    beta = max(0,beta)
    sigma = max(0,sigma)
    
    return beta*y*(1-z) - sigma*y
{% endhighlight %}
